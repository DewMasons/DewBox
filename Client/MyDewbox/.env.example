# API Configuration
# The application automatically uses the correct API URL based on environment:
# - Development (npm run dev): http://localhost:4000
# - Production (npm run build): Uses VITE_API_URL from .env.production

# For Production Deployment:
# Update .env.production with your Railway backend URL
VITE_API_URL=https://your-production-api.railway.app

# Environment is automatically set by Vite
# - development: When running npm run dev
# - production: When running npm run build
